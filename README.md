# Representing-and-Manipulating-Data
An analysis of the book, Around the World in 80 Days by Jules Verne. 
The project makes use of NLTK Sentiment Analysis (using VADER tool in the nltk library).
This is a project that I worked as part of my master's degree in Data Science for Business. It deals with the representation and manipulation of unstructured data (text).
